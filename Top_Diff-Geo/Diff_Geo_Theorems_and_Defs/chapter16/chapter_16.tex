\section{Integration on Manifolds}

Really all we want to talk about here is Stokes's Theorem.

\begin{prop}
Suppose $D$ and $E$ are open domains of integration in $\Rn$ or $\Hn$, and $G:\ol D \ra \ol E$ is a smooth map that restricts to an orientation-preserving or orientation-reversing diffeomorphism from $D$ to $E$. If $\omega$ is an $n$-form on $\ol E$, then
\[\int_D G^*\omega = \begin{cases} \int_E \omega & \text{if $G$ is orientation-preserving},\\
-\int_E \omega & \text{if $G$ is orientation-reversing}.\end{cases}\]
\end{prop}

\begin{lem}
Suppose $U$ is an open subset of $\Rn$ or $\Hn$, and $K$ is a compact subset of $U$. Then there is an open domain of integration $D$ such that $K\seq D\seq \ol D\seq U$.
\end{lem}

\begin{prop}
Suppose $U, V$ are open subsets of $\Rn$ or $\Hn$, and $G:U\ra V$ is an orientation preserving or orientation reversing diffeomorphism. If $\omega$ is a compactly supported $n$-form on $V$, then
\[\int_V\omega = \pm\int_U G^*\omega,\]
with the positive sing if $G$ is orientation-preserving, and the negative sign otherwise.
\end{prop}

\dfn Suppose that $\omega$ is an $n$-form on $M$ that is compactly supported in the domain of a single smooth chart $(U,\vphi)$ that is either positively or negatively oriented. We define the \df{integral of $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ over M} to be
\[\int_M\omega = \pm\int_{\vphi(U)}(\vphi\inv)^*\omega.\]

\begin{prop}
With $\omega$ as above, $\int_M\omega$ does not depend on the choice of smooth chart whose domain contains $\supp(\omega)$.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
The definition of $\int_M\omega$ above does not depend on the choice of chart or partition of unity.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}[\hl{Properties of Integrals of Forms}]
Suppose $M$ and $N$ are non-empty oriented smooth $n$-manifolds \wowob, and $\omega, \eta$ are compactly supported $n$-forms on $M$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\scshape Linearity:} If $a,b\in \R$, then
    \[\int_M a\omega + b\eta = a\int_m\omega + b\int_M \eta.\]
    \item {\scshape Orientation Reversal:} If $-M$ denotes $M$ with the opposite orientation, then
    \[\int_{-M}\omega = -\int_M\omega.\]
    \item {\scshape Positivity:} If $\omega$ is a positively oriented orientation form, then $\int_M\omega > 0$.
    \item {\scshape Diffeomorphism Invariance:} If $F:N\ra M$ is an orientation-preserving or orientation reversing diffeomorphism
    \[\int_M\omega = \begin{cases} \int_N F^*\omega & \text{if $F$ is orientation-preserving,}\\ -\int_N F^*\omega & \text{if $F$ is orientation-reversing.}\end{cases}\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{thm}[\hlb{Stokes's Theorem}]
Let $M$ be an oriented smooth $n$-manifold with boundary, and let $\omega$ be a compactly supported smooth $(n - 1)$-form on $M$. Then
\[\int_m d\omega = \int_{\bd M}\omega.\]
\end{thm}

\begin{cor}[Integrals of Exact Forms]
If $M$ is a compact oriented smooth manifold without boundary, then the integral of every exact form over $M$ is zero:
\[\int_M d\omega = 0 \quad \text{if $\bd M = 0$}.\]
\end{cor}

\begin{cor}[Integrals of Closed Forms over Boundaries]
Suppose $M$ is a compact oriented smooth manifold with boundary. If $\omega$ is a closed form on $M$, then the integral of $\omega$ over $\bd M$ is zero:
\[\int_{\bd M} \omega = 0\quad\text{if $d\omega = 0$ on $M$}.\]
\end{cor}

\begin{cor}
Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold \wowob, $S\seq M$ is an oriented compact smooth $k$-dimensional submanifold (without boundary), and $\omega$ is a closed $k$-form on $M$. If $\int_S\omega \neq 0$, then both of the following are true:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $\omega$ is not exact on $M$.
    \item $S$ is not the boundary of an oriented compact smooth submanifold with boundary in $M$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{cor}

\setcounter{thm}{25}

\begin{thm}
  \hl{Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold and $\ga_0, \ga_1:[a,b]\ra M$ are path-homotopic, piecewise smooth curve segments. For every closed 1-form $\omega$ on $M$,}
  \[\int_{\ga_0}\omega = \int_{\ga_1}\omega.\]
\end{thm}
