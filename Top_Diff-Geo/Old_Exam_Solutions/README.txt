These are all of my solutions for the previous prelim exams. I don't guarantee that any 
of them are correct, but any questions that are not labeled with a *, I am pretty confident
in. Note: none of the questions that dealt with Riemannian Geometry have a solution because
we did not cover that in the first year Diff Geo class, and it is likely that they will 
be dropping that from the exam syllabus relatively soon. 

If you see any errors, feel free to contact me, and I will make sure to add the fixes in.
Thank you and good luck!
